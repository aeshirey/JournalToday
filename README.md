# Journal Today

Journal Today is a very simple, very lightweight journaling application. The goal of JournalToday is to encourage users to keep a daily journal (for whatever topics interest them). 

* No interface fluff keeps it simple
* Small file size (~750kb) makes it easy to store on your OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc
* Portable SQLite database prevents lock-in

JournalToday encourages daily journaling by strictly limiting your ability to create/edit journal entries to **today only**. You cannot create future journals or revise previous days.
